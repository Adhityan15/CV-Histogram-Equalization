# Histogram Equalization using OpenCV

Histogram Equalization using OpenCV
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Histogram Equalization using Python and OpenCV to enhance the contrast of a grayscale image.

Histogram Equalization improves image contrast by redistributing pixel intensity values, making details more visible in low-contrast images.

🎯 Aim

To implement Histogram Equalization on a grayscale image using Python and OpenCV.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

🧠 Concept Explanation
🔹 What is Histogram?

A histogram represents the frequency distribution of pixel intensities in an image.

🔹 What is Histogram Equalization?

Histogram Equalization spreads out the most frequent intensity values to enhance global contrast.

🔹 Why is it Used?

Improves visibility in dark images

Enhances medical images

Improves satellite imagery

Useful in computer vision preprocessing

⚙️ Algorithm

Read the image in grayscale.

Apply histogram equalization using cv2.equalizeHist().

Display original and equalized images.

Plot histograms for comparison.
